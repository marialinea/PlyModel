# PlyModel

This repository contains the [source code](https://github.com/marialinea/PlyModel/blob/master/code/PlyModel.py) to PlyModel.py, which is developed for verifying a variety of geometric features in a 3D triangle polygonial model. Along with the source code, a test program is uploaded as an example to show how the class can be used. 

For a more extensive description of the class and its methods, see [documentation](https://github.com/marialinea/PlyModel/tree/master/documentation).
